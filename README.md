ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

ABSTRACT

Our Project entitled “Rock Paper Scissors”. This project is aimed at developing an online Rock Paper Scissor game website for users. Rock Paper Scissors game is a project developed for playing the game online with the computer when u are alone and don’t have anything to do. 
The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic hand game now implemented as both a web-based and console application. This project allows users to play against a computer by selecting one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The system compares inputs and declares the winner based on well-known rules. The goal is to create an engaging and interactive user experience while demonstrating JavaScript and Python logic integration.



INTRODUCTION

Rock Paper Scissors is a game of chance traditionally played with hand gestures. This project digitizes the experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. The web version features a graphical interface where users select their move, while the Python version is a simple terminal-based interaction. The project highlights front-end design, logic handling, and user input processing. 



AIM

•	To develop an interactive Rock Paper Scissors game using web technologies and Python.
•	To compare gameplay logic implementation across graphical and command-line interfaces.
•	To enhance programming and UI/UX skills through a fun, practical project.



ADVANTAGES

•	Simple and fun game that demonstrates logic building.
•	Responsive user interface with animations and dynamic feedback.
•	Suitable for both beginners and intermediate developers.
•	Dual version (Web and Python) shows language versatility.



DISADVANTAGES

•	No multiplayer support; limited to single user vs. computer.
•	The randomness of the computer's choice lacks strategic depth.
•	No persistent score saving or analytics.



FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION

•	Add multiplayer (online or local).
•	Store high scores and win/loss history using a backend database.
•	Implement advanced AI strategies (e.g., pattern learning).
•	Add more animations and audio for immersive experience.
•	Convert into a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.



SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


Hardware:

•	Minimum 2 GB RAM
•	Dual-core processor or higher
•	Display capable of 1024x768 resolution




Software:

•	Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
•	Python 3.x
•	Code Editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
•	Operating System: Windows/Linux/MacOS

Algorithm

•	Start
•	Get number of rounds from the user.
•	Loop through rounds:
•	User selects Rock/Paper/Scissors.
•	Computer randomly selects one.
•	Compare choices:
o	Rock beats Scissors
o	Paper beats Rock
o	Scissors beats Paper
•	Declare round winner.
•	Update score.
•	After final round, declare overall winner.
•	Ask if the user wants to play again.
•	End



Implementation


Frontend (Web Version):

o	HTML: Provides structure (buttons, input, display).
o	CSS: Provides responsive styling and animations.
o	JavaScript: Handles game logic, events, score updates, and UI interactions.



Backend (Python Console Version):

o	Uses input() and print() for interactions.
o	Random module selects the computer’s move.
o	Loops and conditionals determine round outcomes.
